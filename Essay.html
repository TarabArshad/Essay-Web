            1. MY FAVOURITE PERSONALITY

        </h1>
        <p>
            Introduction: All men are the best creations of the Almighty Allah. Yet the qualities of each and everyone
            are not the same and similar. A man within his short span of life may come in touch with many men, but all
            are not admired equally. Up to the very moment of my life, I have found many men and studied the life and
            works of many men both alive and dead. Amongst them, I admire Hazrat Muhammad (sm) — the last prophet of the
            Muslims.

        </p>
        <p>
            His birth and parentage: He was born in the famous Quraish family of Macca in 570 AD. His father was
            Abdullah and mother was Amina. He was a posthumous child because he lost his father before he was born. Then
            he was brought up by Abdul Mutaleb – his grandfather and later by Abu Taleb — his uncle.

            Why I admire him: I admire him for some reasonable reasons. The qualities I found in him through reading
            books and hearing from the eminent olamayee kerams were extraordinary.
        </p>
        <p>
            His early life: His early life was quite different from other men in the world. Truly speaking, he was a
            class by himself from all times to come. He was very thoughtful. He was the lover and worshiper of truth and
            beauty. He never told lies but spoke the truth at all costs. People in Arabia either friend or foe called
            him AlAmin – the trustworthy.

            His youth: My admired man was very honest to the penny since his boyhood. He liked living a very plain life.
            At the age of 25, he married Khawdija Begum — a 40 years old lady by dint of his stainless character. She
            was the then richest lady in Arabia. He got an immense wealth from her but he spent it on the well-being of
            the poor.

            His preaching religion: My admired man declared the Oneness of Allah. He contemplated in the Mount Hera. He
            attempted to preach Islam all over Arabia. Then people in Arabia were very ignorant and dunderheaded. They
            hated Hazrat Muhammad (sm) and did not believe in his teachings the dictates of Allah. They believed in many
            gods and goddesses. He faced a lot of Troubles in preaching Islam. It was his only target of life to declare
            the oneness of Allah and to preach Islam and its teachings. When he attained the age of forty, the holy
            Quran was revealed on him. Ile taught the common people the dictates and ideals of the Quran. Ile preached,
            “He is the best of you who reads the Quran and Teaches others.”
            Hizrat: The Arabs in those days were the worshipers of many gods and goddesses. His youth: My admired man
